\makeheader

CoreErlang is a haskell library which consists on a parser and
pretty-printer for the intermediate language used by Erlang. The parser uses
the Parsec library and the pretty-printer was modelled after the
corresponding module of the haskell-src package. It also exposes a Syntax
module which allows easy manipulation of terms.

It is able to parse and pretty print all of Core Erlang. Remaining work
includes customizing the pretty printer and refining the syntax interface.
